                We built Aivory to help you transform your business operations, not to
                bury you in legal language. Here&apos;s what this document says in plain
                terms: use Aivory fairly, don&apos;t do anything harmful with it, and
                we&apos;ll keep building something you can trust. The full details are below.
              </p>

              <SectionTitle>1. Who we are</SectionTitle>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                Aivory is a business operations transformation platform built to help
                organisations assess, plan, and deploy AI. When you use Aivory, you&apos;re
                agreeing to these terms. If you&apos;re using Aivory on behalf of an
                organisation, you&apos;re agreeing on their behalf too.

              <SectionTitle>2. Your account</SectionTitle>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                You&apos;re responsible for keeping your account secure. Use a strong
                password. Don&apos;t share your login. If something looks wrong — tell us
                immediately at hello@aivory.uk.
              </p>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                We reserve the right to suspend accounts that violate these terms.
                We&apos;ll always try to give you notice first, unless the situation is
                urgent.

              <SectionTitle>3. What you can do with Aivory</SectionTitle>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                Use it to assess your operations, build your blueprint, deploy your
                workflows, and run your AI operations. That&apos;s what we built it for.
              </p>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                What you can&apos;t do: use Aivory to build anything harmful, illegal, or
                designed to deceive others. Don&apos;t reverse-engineer the platform, resell
                access without permission, or use it in ways that damage other users or
                Aivory itself.

              <p className={leadClass}>
                Anything you create inside Aivory — your assessments, blueprints,
                workflows, agent configurations — belongs to you. We don&apos;t claim
                ownership of your work.
              </p>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                We need limited access to your content to operate the platform — for
                example, to run your workflows or display your data in the console.
                That&apos;s it. We don&apos;t use your content to train our AI models.

              <p className={leadClass}>
                Everything we built — the platform, the interface, the template library,
                the underlying systems — belongs to Aivory. You get a license to use it
                while you&apos;re a customer. That license ends when your account does.

                Subscription plans are billed monthly or annually. One-time products like
                the Deep Assessment and Blueprint are charged at purchase.
              </p>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                If something doesn&apos;t work the way we said it would, contact us within 7
                days at hello@aivory.uk and we&apos;ll make it right — either with a fix or a
                refund. We don&apos;t offer refunds for change of mind on one-time purchases,
                but we&apos;re reasonable people. Talk to us.

                We work hard to keep Aivory running. But no platform is perfect. We
                don&apos;t guarantee 100% uptime, and we&apos;re not liable for losses caused by
                downtime, bugs, or things outside our control.
              </p>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                If something breaks on our end, we&apos;ll fix it as fast as we can and be
                transparent about what happened.

                You can cancel your account anytime. Your data will be available for 30
                days after cancellation, then permanently deleted.
              </p>
              <p className={leadClass}>
                We can terminate accounts that violate these terms. In most cases,
                we&apos;ll warn you first. In serious cases — fraud, illegal activity,
                security threats — we may act immediately.

                If we make significant changes, we&apos;ll notify you by email at least 14
                days before they take effect. Continuing to use Aivory after that means
                you accept the new terms.
