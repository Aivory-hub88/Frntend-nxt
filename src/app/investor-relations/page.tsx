            <p>
              We have become aware that private technology companies are frequently targeted by bad actors who create fraudulent investment schemes, offering retail investors access to shares that don&apos;t exist, through channels that were never authorized.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white font-medium">To be clear:</strong> any offer to invest in Aivory™ that does not come directly from Aivory™ is not legitimate. We do not offer equity investments, pre-IPO shares, or debt instruments through brokers, agents, or third-party funds. If someone approaches you with an opportunity to invest in Aivory™, exercise caution. It is very likely a scam.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you believe you have been targeted by such an offer, we encourage you to report it to your local financial regulator or law enforcement authority.
