/**
 * Every user-visible string in the free Business Operations Assessment, in
 * English and Indonesian.
 *
 * It lives outside page.tsx because the assessment carries roughly 180 strings
 * — twelve questions with four options each, twenty-four insight lines, five
 * band narratives — and interleaving two languages with the scoring engine
 * would bury the logic.
 *
 * Two rules hold this together:
 *
 * 1. **Identifiers never translate.** Question ids, dimension keys and the
 *    maturity band names are load-bearing: they are JSONB keys in
 *    `assessment_leads.answers`, they are compared against the paid product's
 *    `maturityFromScore`, and they are stored in `assessment_leads.maturity`.
 *    Only their *labels* appear here. A lead answered in Indonesian and one
 *    answered in English must remain the same row shape.
 *
 * 2. **English is British.** `organisation`, `standardised`, `prioritised`.
